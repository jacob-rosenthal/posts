My passion is developing computational tools to learn useful information from vast troves of biomedical data (images, text, genomics, etc.) and finding ways to apply them in the realms of clinical medicine and basic research in order to tangibly improve patient care and advance our fundamental knowledge of the biological processes underlying disease.

I am interested in the technical aspects (data engineering, software development, machine learning methods, etc.) as well as the biomedical aspects (clinical workflows, diagnostics, cancer biology, etc.). My work lies at the intersection of medicine and machine learning, aiming to bridge the gap between these two worlds. 

I currently work as a data scientist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Before that, I studied data science at Harvard University. Before that, I studied biology at Oberlin College. Before that, I grew up in Seattle.
