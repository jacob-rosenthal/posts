            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive.

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .

            "title": "Building a Camera Obscura",
            "content": "About . For this project, I worked with my partner Lucie Gillet to build a camera obscura from scratch. We worked on this as part of an assignment for MIT 6.869: Advances in Computer Vision (Fall 2019) taught by Professors Bill Freeman, Antonio Torralba, and Philip Isola. Course website here. . What is a camera obscura? . A camera obscura is a dark chamber with a single, tiny hole (the pinhole) in one side that lets light in. Rays of light from the outside enter the pinhole, and hit the wall opposite the pinhole, forming a projected image: . . The image is inverted top-bottom and right-left because it is projected through the pinhole. . The image is projected inside the camera - so how do we see it? Some camera obscuras are built as structures large enough to go inside and look at the projection on a screen. However, in our case we created a small camera from a cardboard box and then used the digital cameras on our phones to capture the projected images. . How to build the pinhole camera . Instructions copied from the assignment . Find a cardboard box. | Make a tiny hole (~= 5 mm) in the center of one of the faces. This will be your pinhole. | Make a second hole, just big enough for your camera. If you’re using a professional camera, make a hole just wide enough for your lens to fit. If you’re using a phone, make a small hole such that you can press your phone to the box, and the camera will not be obstructed. | Cover the inside walls with black paper to reduce inter-reflections. | Place a sheet (or more) of white paper on the wall opposite your pinhole. This white paper will be the screen onto which your image is projected. | (Optional) You may also want to use dark tape along the edges and corners of your box - where two separate pieces of cardboard meet, there may a small slit, which can let light in! (we ended up wrapping the whole camera in foil to solve this problem) | . Here’s what our camera looked like from the outside: . . And here is a side view of the inside, showing the arrangement of the pinholes and the screen: . . Taking Pictures . Since a camera obscura lets in so little light (to keep the image sharp), we made sure to get as much light as possible by taking our pictures outside, in the daytime, on a sunny day. . In our first attempt, we learned the camera must remain perfectly still - if it moves at all, the images will be blurry: . . After some trial and error, we managed to capture some good quality pictures: . . . Conclusion . Making a camera obscura is a fun afternoon project, and you can get surprisingly good results! Make sure to block out all light from entering the box through holes or cracks, and try it out on a sunny day! .",

My work lies at the intersection of medicine and machine learning, aiming to bridge the gap between these two worlds. I am interested in both the technical aspects (data engineering, software development, machine learning methods, etc.) as well as the biomedical aspects (clinical workflows, diagnostics, cancer biology, etc.). . I currently work as a data scientist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Before that, I studied data science at Harvard University. Before that, I studied biology at Oberlin College.
